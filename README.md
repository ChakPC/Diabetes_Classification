# Diabetes_Classification
This is a Machine Learning problem which uses the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm

The problem statement is that you have to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic on the basis of several probable numerical
factors like Glucose level, Pregnancies, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree function and Age. 

K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm is analogous to the Distance formula. The root squared difference of the testing and training data is made 
the basis for sorting out the K nearest cases in training set to the tested set. Then a majority vote count is taken among these neighbours 
and this vote gives the class of the testing data (In this case Diabetic or Non-Diabetic).
This model is trained over randomly generated data but this project can be equally accurate in real-life scenarios. This project may prove 
to be a prototype of a major application in health sector.
